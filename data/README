This is a partial download of the OASIS-3 dataset.

Users should interface with this through the oasis3.h5 file as well as the
subject_metadata.csv.

The `/scan_labels` dataset in the h5 file allows one to
join against the csv to get all the available metadata. Note that for some
reason age was not available at the time of download.

The most relevant data resides in the `/skullstripped` dataset which is of size
(1983,256,256,256) and holds all 1983 downloadable skull-stripped brain images.
This dataset employs LZF compression with each individual image constituting a
"chunk" (chunk_size=(1,256,256,256)). This should enable somewhat efficient
random image access, and greatly improved writing speed.

NOTE: There are 1984 listed Freesurfers on central.xnat.org, but one of them,
OAS30336_Freesurfer53_d0244 is empty.

For detailed information about this data, see the website
https://oasis-brains.org, as well as the downloaded data dictionary (PDF file)
in this directory.
